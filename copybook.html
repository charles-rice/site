AS I PASS through my incarnations in every age and race,<br>
I make my proper prostrations to the Gods of the Market Place.<br>
Peering through reverent fingers I watch them flourish and fall,<br>
And the Gods of the Copybook Headings, I notice, outlast them all.<br> <br>

We were living in trees when they met us. They showed us each in turn<br>
That Water would certainly wet us, as Fire would certainly burn:<br>
But we found them lacking in Uplift, Vision and Breadth of Mind,<br>
So we left them to teach the guerillas while we followed the March of Mankind.<br> <br>

We moved as the Spirit listed. They never altered their pace,<br>
Being neither cloud nor wind-borne like the Gods of the Market Place,<br>
But they always caught up with our progress, and presently word would come<br>
That a tribe had been wiped off its icefield, or the lights had gone out in Rome.<br> <br>

With the Hopes that our World is built on they were utterly out of touch,<br>
They denied that the Moon was Stilton; they denied she was even Dutch;<br>
They denied that Wishes were Horses; they denied that a Pig had Wings;<br>
So we worshipped the Gods of the Market Who promised these beautiful things.<br> <br>

When the Cambrian measures were forming, They promised perpetual peace.<br>
They swore, if we gave them our weapons, that the wars of the tribes would cease.<br>
But when we disarmed They sold us and delivered us bound to our foe,<br>
And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: <i>"Stick to the Devil you know."</i> <br> <br>

On the first Feminian Sandstones we were promised the Fuller Life<br>
(Which started by loving our neighbour and ended by loving his wife)<br>
Till our women had no more children and the men lost reason and faith,<br>
And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: <i>"The Wages of Sin is Death."</i> <br> <br>

In the Carboniferous Epoch we were promised abundance for all, <br>
By robbing selected Peter to pay for collective Paul; <br>
But, though we had plenty of money, there was nothing our money could buy, <br>
And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: <i>"If you don't work you die." </i><br> <br>

Then the Gods of the Market tumbled, and their smooth-tongued wizards withdrew<br>
And the hearts of the meanest were humbled and began to believe it was true<br>
That All is not Gold that Glitters, and Two and Two make Four<br>
And the Gods of the Copybook Headings limped up to explain it once more.<br> <br>

As it will be in the future, it was at the birth of Man<br>
There are only four things certain since Social Progress began. <br>
That the Dog returns to his Vomit and the Sow returns to her Mire, <br>
And the burnt Fool's bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire;<br> <br>

And that after this is accomplished, and the brave new world begins<br>
When all men are paid for existing and no man must pay for his sins, <br>
As surely as Water will wet us, as surely as Fire will burn, <br>
The Gods of the Copybook Headings with terror and slaughter return! <br> <br>
